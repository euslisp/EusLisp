\markright{\arabic{section}. Geometric Modeling}

EusLisp adopts {\emx Brep} (Boundary Representation) as the internal
representation of 3D geometric models.
Components in Breps are represented by classes
{\bf edge, plane, polygon, face, hole,} and {\bf body}.
Primitive body creating functions and body composition functions
create new instances of these classes.
In order to use your private geometric classes having
more attributes,
set special variables
{\bf *edge-class*, *face-class*} and {\bf *body-class*}
to your class objects.

{\bf Triangle} is positive if {\em a,b}, and {\em c} turn clockwise

\funcdesc{make-cube}{xsize ysize zsize \&key name color}{
makes a cuboid whose sizes in x, y and z directions are {\em xsize, ysize}
and {\em zsize}.
The coordinates origin of this cuboid locates at the center of the body.}

\funcdesc{make-prism}{bottom-points sweep-vector \&key name color}{
Makes a prism by lifting the shape defined by {\em bottom-points}
along {\em sweep-vector}.
If the {\em sweep-vector} is a number, not a float-vector,
it is taken as the height of the prism in the $z$ direction.
Bottom points must be ordered as they define the bottom face of the body.
For example,
 (make-prism '(\#f(1 1 0) \#f(1 -1 0) \#f(-1 -1 0) \#f(-1 1 0)) 2.0)
makes a cube of height 2.0.}

\funcdesc{make-cylinder}{radius height \&key (segments 12) name color}{
Makes a cylinder with specified {\em radius} and {\em height}.
The bottom face is defined on xy-plane and the coordinates origin is
located at the center of the bottom face.}

\funcdesc{make-cone}{top bottom \&key (segments 16) color name}{
makes a cone body whose summit is the {\em top}
and bottom face is the {\em bottom}.
{\em Top} is a 3D float-vector.
{\em Bottom} is either a list of vertices of the bottom face or a radius
(scalar). If it is the vertices list, it is order sensitive.
\verb~ (make-cone \#f(0 0 10) (list \#f(10 0 0) \#f(0 10 0) \#f(-10 0 0) 
\#f(0 -10 0)))~ makes a cone of a square bottom.}


\funcdesc{make-solid-of-revolution}{points \&key (segments 16) name color}{
{\em Points} are revolted along z-axis in the clock wise direction.
If two end points in the {\em points} list do not lie on z axis,
those points make circular faces. Thus,
{\tt (make-solid-of-revolution '(\#f(0 0 1) \#f(1 0 0)))}
makes a cone, and 
{\tt (make-solid-of-revolution '(\#f(1 0 1) \#f(1 0 0)))}
makes a cylinder.
The {\em points} are order-sensitive,
and are expected to be arranged from higher $z$ coordinate
to lower $z$.}

\funcdesc{make-torus}{points \&key (segments 16) name color}{
makes a torus, a donuts like object.
{\em Points} is a list of vertices on a cross-section.}

\funcdesc{make-icosahedron}{\&optional (radius 1.0)}{
Makes a regular body of twenty faces.
Each face is a regular triangle.}

\funcdesc{make-dodecahedron}{\&optional (radius 1.0)}{
Makes a regular body of twelve faces.
Each face is a regular pentagon.}

\funcdesc{make-gdome}{abody}{
By subdividing triangle faces of abody into four subfacets,
makes a geodesic dome as a new body. Abody should be an icosahedron
initially, and then the result of make-gdome can be given to make-gdome
recursively.
At each call, the number of faces of the Gdome increases
by the factor of four,
i.e. 20, 80, 320, 1280, 5120, etc.

\funcdesc{grahamhull}{vertices \&optional (normal \#f(0 0 1))}{
Computes convex-hull for 2D points by Graham's algorithm. Slower than
quickhull.}

\funcdesc{quickhull}{vertices \&optional (normal \#f(0 0 1))}{
Computes convex-hull for 2D points by the binary search method.}

\funcdesc{convex-hull-3d}{vertices}{
Computes convex-hull for 3D points by gift-wrapping method.}
\funcdesc{make-body-from-vertices}{vertices-list}{
creates a body from lists of vertices each of which define
a loop of a face in the consistent order.}

\begin{refdesc}

\fundesc{face+}{face1 face2}
\funcdesc{face*}{face1 face2}{
{\em face1} and {\em face2} are coplanar faces in 3D space.
{\bf face+} composes union of these faces and returns a face object.
If there is no intersection, original two faces are returned.
{\bf face*} returns intersection of these faces.
If there is no intersection, NIL is returned.}

\funcdesc{cut-body}{body cutting-plane}{
Cuts a body by the {\em cutting-plane}
and returns a list of faces made at the cross-section.}

\fundesc{body+}{body1 body2 \&rest more-bodies}
\fundesc{body-}{body1 body2}
\funcdesc{body*}{body1 body2}{
Computes join, difference or intersection of two or more bodies.
Each body is copied before each {\bf body+, body-} and {\bf body*} operation,
and original bodies are unchanged.
The new coordinates of the resulted body is located and oriented
at the same location and orientation as the world coordinates.
Even when two bodies are touching face by face,
these functions are expected to work correctly
if threshold parameters
{\tt *coplanar-threshold*, *contact-threshold*,} and {\tt *parallel-threshold*}
are properly set.
However, if a vertex of a body is in contact with an edge or a face
of the other body, any composition operation fails.}

\funcdesc{body/}{body plane}{
Cut the body by a plane which is an instance of class plane
(made by {\bf make-plane}).
A newly created body is returned.}

\funcdesc{body-interference}{\&rest bodies}{
Checks interference between each one-to-one combination in {\em bodies}.
Returns a list of two bodies  that are intersecting.
}

\subsection{Coordinates-axes}
Class coordinates-axes defines 3D coordinates-axes drawable on a screen.
Each axis and an arrow at the tip of z-axis are defined by line objects.
Since the coordinates-axes class inherits cascaded-coords,
a coordinates-axes object can be attached
to another cascaded-coords originated object such as a body.
This object is used to see the coordinates-axes of a body or a
relative coordinates to another coordinates.

\begin{refdesc}
\classdesc{coordinates-axes}{cascaded-coords}
{(size model-points points lines)}{Defines drawable 3-D coordinates-axes.}
