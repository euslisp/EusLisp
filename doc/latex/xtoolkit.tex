\markright{\arabic{section}. XToolKit}

XToolKit is the highest level X window interface to facilitate composing
GUI (Graphical User Interface) by using GUI components such as
buttons, pulldown menus, textWindows, etc., as building blocks.
The major differences from the Xlib classes are,
the XToolKit invokes user-supplied interaction routines
corresponding to the Xevents sent from the Xserver,
and provides consistent appearance of those interaction-oriented
window parts.
Classes consisting the XToolKit has the following inheritance structure.
\begin{verbatim}
          xwindow
               panel
                    menubar-panel
                    menu-panel
                    filepanel
                    textviewpanel
                    confirmpanel
               panel-item
                    button-item
                         menu-button-item
                         bitmap-button-item
                    text-item
                    slider-item
                    choice-item
                    joystick-item
               canvas
               textwindow
                    buffertextwindow
                         scrolltextwindow
                    textedit
               scroll-bar
                    horizontal-scroll-bar
\end{verbatim}

Just below the xwindow class are the five basic XToolKit classes:
{\tt panel}, {\tt panel-item},
{\tt canvas}, {\tt textWindow} and {\tt scroll-bar}.
{\tt Menubar-panel} and {\tt menu-panel} are defined under the {\tt panel}.
A basic strategy to build a new application window and to make
it run upon events is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf define an application class} An application window class should be
defined as a subclass of {\bf panel} that has the capability to lay out
XToolKit components.
\item{\bf define event handlers} In the application class, event handlers
that are called upon when buttons are pressed or menu items are selected
are defined. An event handler ought to be defined as a method 
with panel-item specific arguments.
\item{\bf define subpanels} If you use a {\tt menubar-panel}, it is placed at the
top of the application window, therefore it should be created first
by {\tt :create-menubar}. Similarly {\tt menu-panel}s needs to be
defined before the {\tt menu-button-item}s to which {\tt menu-panel}s
are associated.
\item{\bf create panel-items} Panel-items such as {\tt button-item},
{\tt text-item}, {\tt slider-item}, etc., can be created
by {\tt (send-super :create-item {\em class label object method})}.
Event handlers defined above are connected to each panel-item.
These initialization procedures should be defined in the {\tt :create}
method of the application window class.
Do not forget to define {\tt quit} button to make the event
dispatcher terminate whenever needed.
Any {\tt textWindow} and {\tt canvas} can also be placed in the application
window via the {\tt :locate-item} method.
\item{\bf create the entire window} Sending the {\tt :create} message to
the application class creates
the application window with its XToolKit components properly placed 
in the window.
%If you do not like the default placement, add {\tt :x} and {\tt :y}
%parameters at the creation of each component.
\item{\bf run the event dispatcher} In order to receive events from the
Xserver and delivers them to the corresponding xwindow,
run {\tt window-main-loop}.
On Solaris2, {\tt window-main-thread}, which delivers events in a
different thread, is available.
{\tt Window-main-thread} keeps the toplevel interaction alive.
Do not run more than one {\tt window-main-thread}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{X Event}

In the current implementation, 
an event structure is received in a fixed event buffer (an integer-vector
of 25 elements)
and the same buffer is reused on all events.
The event structure has to be copied when more than one events need to
be referenced at the same time.

{\tt Window-main-loop} is the function which captures all events sent
from the X server and delivers them to each window where the event happened.

\begin{refdesc}

\vardesc{event}{a 25-element integer-vector holding the most recent
event structure.}

\funcdesc{next-event}{}{
stores the event structure in {\tt event} and returns it
if there is at least one pending event,
NIL if there is no pending event.}

\funcdesc{event-type}{event}{
returns the keyword symbol representing the event-type in the {\em event}
structure. The event-type keywords are:
{\tt :KeyPress} (2),
{\tt :KeyRelease} (3),
{\tt :ButtonPress} (4),
{\tt :ButtonRelease} (5),
{\tt :MotionNotify} (6),
{\tt :EnterNotify} (7),
{\tt :LeaveNotify} (8),
{\tt :FocusIn} (9),
{\tt :FocusOut} (0),

{\tt :CreateNotify} (16),
{\tt :DestroyNotify} (17),
{\tt :UnmapNotify} (18),
{\tt :MapNotify} (19),
{\tt :MapRequest} (20),

{\tt :SelectionNotify} (31),
{\tt :ColormapNotify} (32),
{\tt :ClientMessage} (33),
{\tt :MappingNotify} (34),
{\tt :LASTEvent} (35).}

\funcdesc{event-window}{event}{
returns the window object where the {\em event} occurred.}

\funcdesc{event-x}{event}{extracts the {\em x} coordinate,
(i.e., the horizontal position of the mouse pointer relatively in the window)
out of the {\em event}.}
\funcdesc{event-y}{event}{extracts the {\em x} coordinate,
(i.e., the vertical position of the mouse pointer relatively in the window)
out of the {\em event}.}
\funcdesc{event-width}{event}{
returns the eighth element of the {\em event} structure
which represents the width parameter at the {\tt :configureNotify} event.}
\funcdesc{event-height}{event}{
returns the ninth element of the {\em event} structure
which represents the height parameter at the {\tt :configureNotify} event.}
\funcdesc{event-state}{event}{
returns a list of keywords representing the mouse button 
and modifier key state.
Keywords are: {\tt :shift, :control, :meta, :left, :middle} and {\tt :right}.
For example, if left mouse button is pressed while shift key is down,
{\tt (:shift :left)} is returned.}
\funcdesc{display-events}{}{displays all xwindow events captured by
{\tt x:nextevent}. Control-C is the only way to terminate this function.}

\macrodesc{window-main-loop}{\&rest forms}{
receives Xevents and delivers them to window objects where the event
occurred.
According to the event-type, methods in the window's class named 
{\tt :KeyPress, :KeyRelease, :ButtonPress,
:ButtonRelease, :MotionNotify,
:EnterNotify, :LeaveNotify} and {\tt :ConfigureNotify} 
are invoked with {\em event} as the argument.
If {\em forms} is given,
evaluates them each time event arrival is checked.}

\funcdesc{window-main-thread}{}{
Do the same thing as {\tt window-main-loop} in a different thread.
{\tt Window-main-thread} is only available on Solaris2.
{\tt Window-main-thread} installs an error handler which
does not enter a read-eval-print loop.
After printing the error information, the event
processing continues.}

{\tt Menu-panel} is a kind of panel that can locate only 
{\tt button-item}s and/or {\tt bitmap-button-item}s.
Unlike {\tt panel}, however, {\tt menu-panel} is normally invisible
and is exposed when the {\tt button-item} to which the {\tt menu-panel} is
associated is pressed.
If a {\tt menu-panel} is made always visible, it becomes a pinned menu.
The response of each button-item to mouse events is slightly different from
button-items in other panels,
as the mouse button has been pressed somewhere outside the button-item.
Creation of a {\tt menu-panel} should follow the order described below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item create a menu-panel by {\tt (instance menu-panel :create)}.
\item create button-items or/and bitmap-button-items and locate them in the
menu-panel by {\tt (send aMenuPanel :create-item button-item "BTN" obj meth)}.
\item create a menu-button-item in another panel and associate the menu-panel
with the menu-button-item by {\tt (instance menu-button-item :create
"Option" obj meth :menu-window aMenuPanel)}.
\end{enumerate}

A menubar-panel is created by the panel's {\tt :create-menubar} method.}

\end{refdesc}

\subsubsection{File Panel}
The FilePanel is an application window for the interactive  manipulation
of files and directories.
Using {\tt cd} and {\tt go-up} buttons, any directory can be visited
and files contained in the directory are displayed in the {\tt ScrollTextWindow}
below.
Text files can be displayed in different windows (textViewPanel).
Files can also be printed, removed, and compiled by simply cliking buttons.
When a file is printed, {\tt a2ps {\em file} | lpr} commands are executed
in a forked process.

\subsubsection{Text View Panel}

TextViewPanel is an application window class to display text files
(Fig. \ref{textviewpanel}).
The program text is shown to demonstrate how 
one of the simplest application windows is described.
In the {\tt :create} method, the quit button and find button,
and a text-item to feed the string to be searched for in the file
are created.
The view-window is a ScrollTextWindow that displays the file
with the vertical and horizontal scroll-bars.
The TextViewPanel captures {\tt :ConfigureNotify} event
to resize the view-window when the outermost title window is resized
by the window manager.

\begin{refdesc}
\classdesc{text-item}{panel-item}
{(textwin)}{
{\tt Text-item} is used to display or to input one short line of text,
such as a file name.
A {\tt text-item} has a label string followed by
a small textwindow on the right.
When the pointer is put in the textwindow, key input is enabled
and the characters typed are buffered.
Line editing is available in the textwindow: 
{\tt control-F} and {\tt control-B} to move forward/backward by one character,
{\tt del} to delete the character on the left of the cursor,
{\tt control-D} to delete the character on the cursor, and
any graphical character to insert it at the cursor position.
Clicking a mouse button moves the cursor to the clicked character.
Hitting an enter (newline) key causes the buffered text to be sent to
the {\em notify-object}'s {\em notify-method}.}

%if key is pressed, print key character to cursor position.}

%\methoddesc{:keyEnter}{ch}{
%prints {\em ch} to cursor position. But if {\em ch} is backspace,

\subsection{Canvas}
\begin{refdesc}
\classdesc{canvas}{xwindow}{(topleft bottomright)}{
Canvas is a xwindow to interact with figures or images.
Currently, only the region selection capability has been implemented.
At the buttonPress event, the canvas begins to draw a rectangle
with the topleft corner at the pressed position and bottomright corner
at the current pointer.
ButtonRelease causes the {\tt notify-method} to be sent to the {\tt notify-object}.
Use Xdrawable's methods to draw figures or images in the canvas.}

\subsection{Text Window}

There are three textwindow classes, {\tt TextWindow}, {\tt BufferTextWindow}
and {\tt ScrollTextWindow}.

\begin{refdesc}

\>notify-object notify-method \\
\>)}{
realizes virtual terminals usable for displaying messages.
The displayed contents are not buffered and there is no way to retrieve
a line or a character already displayed in the TextWindow.
Basically, {\tt TextWindow} has similar capabilities to the dumb terminals,
that are, moving the cursor, erasing lines, erasing areas,
scrolling displayed texts, inserting strings, etc.
Also, the text cursor can be moved to the position designated by 
the mouse pointer.}

\methoddesc{:init}{id}{
