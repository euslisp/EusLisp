\subsection{Viewing}
A viewing object manages viewing coordinate system
whose origin is located at the position of a virtual camera,
{\em -z} axis is oriented to the objects observed, and xy-plane is the
projection screen.
Since viewing inherits class cascaded-coords,
it accepts coordinates transformation message
such as {\bf :translate, :rotate} and {\bf :transform}.
Also, it can be attached to another object derived from cascaded-coords,
allowing the simulation of the camera-on-mobile-object system.
The main purpose of viewing is to transform vectors represented in the world
to the camera coordinates system.
The transformation is taken in the opposite direction against usual coordinate
transformation where vectors in the local coordinates are transformed into the
representation in the world.
Therefore, viewing holds the inversed left-handed transformation in
the viewcoords slot, which is usually referred as the viewing coordinate system.

\methoddesc{:viewpoint}{}{

\methoddesc{:view-direction}{}{
returns the vector from the origin of the viewing to the center of screen.
This is the z-axis direction of the viewing coordinates.}

\methoddesc{:view-up}{}{
returns y-axis vector of this viewing represented in the world coords.
Y-axis is the upward direction in the viewport.}
\methoddesc{:view-right}{}{
returns x-axis vector of this viewing represented in the world coords.
X-axis is in horizontal direction to the right in the viewport.}

\methoddesc{:look}{from \&optional (to \#f(0 0 0))}{
{\bf :look} conveniently sets the viewing coords as the eye is located
at {\em from} and looking at {\em to} point.}

Since viewing inherits cascaded-coords, all the {\em :init} parameters
such as {\em :pos}, {\em :rot}, {\em :Euler}, {\em :rpy}, etc. can be
used to specify the location and the orientation of the viewing coordinates.
However, viewing's {\em :init} provides easier way to determine the
rotation.
If only {\em :target} is given, view-line (-z axis) is determined to
pass the viewpoint and {\em :target} point, and the {\em :view-right}
vector is determined so that the x-axis is parallel to the xy-plane of the
world coordinates.
You may specify {\em :view-direction} instead of {\em :target} to get the
same effect.
If you give {\em :view-up} or {\em :view-right} parameter in addition to
{\em :target} or {\em :view-direction},
you can determine all the three rotation parameters by yourself.}

\subsection{Projection}

Class {\bf parallel-projection and perspective-projection} process
projection transformation, which is represented with a 4X4 matrix,
i.e., the transformation is taken in the three dimensional homogeneous
coordinates.
Class {\bf projection} is an abstract class for both of these.
Since these projection classes inherit the viewing class,
two coordinates transformation, world-to-viewing and projection
can be performed at the same time.
By sending the {\tt  :project3} message with a 3D vector to a projection object,
a float-vector of four elements is returned.
{\bf Homo2normal} function is used to convert this homogeneous vector
to the normal representation.
The result is a vector represented in so called normalized device coordinates
(NDC), in which a visible vector ranges within -1 to 1
in each of x,y, and z dimensions.
For the simulation of real cameras in a robot world,
the perspective projection is used more often than the parallel-projection.
Perspective-projection defines a few more parameters.
{\tt Screenx} and {\tt screeny} are the sizes of the window on the
viewing plane on which observed objects are projected,
and with the larger screen, the wider space is projected.
{\tt Viewdistance} which defines the distance between the viewpoint
and the viewplane also concerns with the viewing angle.
The larger viewdistance maps the smaller region to the window on the view plane.
{\tt Hither} and {\tt yon} parameters determine the distance to the front and back
depth clipping planes.
Objects outside these two planes are clipped out.
Actually, this clipping procedure is performed by the viewport object.

Objects before the front-clipping (hither) plane are clipped out.}
\methoddesc{:yon}{ depth-to-back-clip-plane}{

\methoddesc{:aspect}{\&optional ratio}{

the aspect ratio is changed by setting screen-y to screen-x * {\em ratio}.

\methoddesc{:viewdistance}{\&optional vd}{
Viewdistance is the distance between viewpoint and the screen.
If {\em vd} is given, it is set to viewdistance.
The viewdistance corresponds to the focal length of a camera.

{\bf :viewdistance} returns the current viewdistance.}
\methoddesc{:view-angle}{\&optional ang}{
set screen size so that the prospective angle of the diagonal of the
screen becomes {\em ang} radian.
Note that angles somewhat between 20 degree (approx. 0.4 rad.)
and 50  degree  (0.9 rad.) can generate a natural perspective view.
Wider angle generates a skewed view, and narrower a flat view like
orthogonal (parallel) viewing.
{\bf :view-angle} returns current or new view angle in radian.}
\methoddesc{:zoom}{\&optional scale}{
If {\em scale} is given, the screen is changed relatively to the
current size by {\em scale}

viewing.}

of the bounding box of all bodies.}
\metdesc{:init}{ \&key (:viewdistance 100.0) \&allow-other-keys}

\end{refdesc}

\subsection{Viewport}

Class {\bf viewport} performs three-dimensional viewport clipping in
the normalized device coordinates, and maps the result into the device
dependent coordinates.
The viewport is the term representing the visible rectangular area
on a screen.
The physical size (dots in x and y) of a viewport should be given with 
{\bf :init} message as the {\em :width} and {\em :height} arguments.
{\em :xcenter} and {\em :ycenter} arguments determine
the physical location of the viewport.
These two parameters actually decide the location where objects are drawn
on the screen when you are using a primitive display device like tektronics
4014 on which every dimension must be given absolutely to the origin of the
screen.
If you are using more sophisticated display device like Xwindows where
locations can be determined relatively to the parent window, you need not
to change viewport's parameters to move the viewport.
These parameters are independent of the actual display location.

Viewport class assumes the origin of the viewport at the lower-left corner of
the rectangular area and y-axis extends to the upper direction.
Unfortunately, in many window systems and display devices, the origin is taken
at the upper-left corner and y-axis extends to the lower direction.
To work around this problem, a negative value should be given to the
{\em :height} parameter.

\begin{refdesc}

\funcdesc{homo-viewport-clip}{v1 v2}{
{\em V1} and {\em v2}, which are two homogeneous vectors with four elements,
represent a line in 3-D space.

and a list of two vectors are returned.
If the line lies completely outside the viewport, NIL is returned.}

\classdesc{viewport}{coordinates}{()}

coordinates.}
\methoddesc{:ndc-point-to-screen}{p}{

the physical address on the screen.}
\methoddesc{:ndc-line-to-screen}{p1 p2 \&optional (do-clip t)}{

{makes a new viewport object.}

\end{refdesc}

\subsection{Viewer}
To get a drawing  on a screen, four objects are needed:
(1) objects to be drawn, (2) a viewing which defines the viewing coordinates
and the projection, (3) a viewport for clipping in NDC and
the transformation from NDC to physical screen coordinates,
and (4) a viewsurface which performs drawing functions on
a physical display device.
A {\bf viewer} object holds a viewing, a viewport and a viewsurface object,
and controls successive coordinates transformation. 
Functions {\bf draw} and {\bf hid} described in section \ref{Drawings}
use the instances of viewer.

\subsection{Animation}
\index{animation}
EusLisp's animation facility provides the pseudo real-time
graphics on stock workstations without graphics accelerators.
The basic idea is the quick playback of a series of images which have been
generated after long computation.
Images are retained in two ways:
one is to keep a number of xwindow pixmaps each of which holds a complete
pixel image, and the other is to keep line segment data obtained by
hidden-line elimination.
The former is faster and the only way for rendered images,
but not suitable for a long animation since it requires much memory
in the X server.
The latter is more memory efficient and suitable for storing data in disks,
but the performance is degraded
when the number of line segments increases.

In either way, the user provide a function which gives new configurations
to the objects to be drawn and generates drawing on {\tt *viewer*}.
{\bf pixmap-animation} calls this function as many times as
specified by the {\em count} argument.
After each call, the content of {\tt *viewsurface*}, which is assumed to
be an xwindow, is copied to a newly created Xwindow pixmap.
These pixmaps are played back by {\bf playback-pixmaps}.
Similarly, {\bf hid-lines-animation} extracts visible line segments
from the result of {\bf hid}, and accumulates them in a list.
The list is then played back by {\bf playback-hid-lines}.

Following functions are defined in {\tt llib/animation.l}, and
{\tt demo/animdemo.l} contains a sample animation program
using {\bf hid-lines-animation} on the ETA3 manipulator model.

\begin{refdesc}
\macrodesc{pixmap-animation}{count \&rest forms}{
