% EusLispは、知能ロボットの研究を目的とした言語で、Common Lispと
% 対象指向型プログラミングに基礎を置いている。ロボットの研究では、
% センサデータの処理、環境認識、障害物回避動作計画、作業計画などが
% 重要なテーマとして取り上げられるが、これらに共通するのは、ロボットと

EusLisp is an integrated programming system 
for the research on intelligent robots
based on Common Lisp and Object-Oriented programming.
The principal subjects
in the field of robotics research are  sensory data processing,
visual environment recognition, collision avoiding motion planning,
and task planning.
In either problem, three dimensional shape models of robots and
environment play crucial roles.
A motivation to the development of EusLisp was a demand for an extensible
solid modeler that can easily be made use of from higher level symbolic
processing system.
Investigations into traditional solid modelers proved that the vital
requirement for their implementation language was the list processing
capability to represent and manage topology among model components.
Numerical computation power was also important, but locality of geometric
computation suggested the provision of vector/matrix functions as
built-ins would greatly ease programming.

Thus the primary decision to build a solid modeler in a Lisp
equipped with a geometric computation package was obtained.
Although a solid modeler provides facilities to define shapes of 3D
objects, to simulate their behaviors, and to display them graphically,
its applications are limited until it is incorporated in robot modules
mentioned above. These modules also need to be tightly interconnected
to achieve fully integrated robot systems.
EusLisp sought for the framework of this integration
in object-oriented programming (OOP).
While OOP promotes modular programming, it facilitates incremental
extension of existing functions by using inheritance of classes.
In fact, components in the solid modeler, such as bodies, faces, and edges,
can orderly be inplemented by extending one of the most basic class
{\em coordinates}.
These components may have further subclasses to provide individual functions
for particular robot applications.

Based upon these considerations, EusLisp has been developped as an
object-oriented Lisp which implements an extensible solid modeler\cite{Eus7}.
Other features include intertask communication needed for the cooperative
task coordination, graphics facilities on X-window for 
visual user interface, and foreign language interface to support
mixed language programming.

In the implementation of the language, two performance-effective techniques
were invented in type discrimination and memory management
\cite{Eus4,Eus5,Eus6}.
The new type discrimination method guarantees 
constant-time discrimination between
types in tree structured hiearchy without regard to the depth of trees.
Heap memory is managed in Fibonacci buddy method, which improves
memory efficiency without sacrificing runtime or garbage-collection
performance.

This reference manual describes EusLisp version 7.27 in two parts,
{\em  EusLisp Basics and EusLisp Extensions}.
The first part describes Common Lisp features and object-oriented 
programming. Since a number of literatures are available on both topics,
the first part is rather indifferent except EusLisp's specific
features as described in {\em Interprocess Communication and Network},
{\em Toplevel Interaction}, {\em Disk Save}, etc.
Beginners of EusLisp are advised to get familiar with
Common Lisp and object oriented programming in other ways
\cite{CLtL,CLOS:Keene}.
The second part deals with features more related with robot applications,
such as
{\em Geometric Modelling}, {\em Image Processing}, {\em Manipulator Model}
and so on.
Unfortunately, 
the descriptions in this part may become incomplete or inaccurate
because of EusLisp's rapid evolution.
The update information is available via euslisp mailing list
as mentioned in section \ref{License}.

\subsection{EusLisp's Object-Oriented Programming}
Unlike other Lisp-based object-oriented programming languages like
CLOS \cite{CLOS:Keene},
EusLisp is a Lisp system built on the basis of object-orientation.
In the former approach, Lisp is used as an
implementation language for the object-oriented programming,
and there is apparent distinction between system defined objects
and user defined objects, since system data types do not have 
corresponding classes.
On the other hand, every data structure in EusLisp except number is 
represented by an object, and there is no inherent difference between
built-in data types, such as {\tt cons} and {\tt symbols},
and user defined classes.
This implies that even the system built-in data types
can be extended (inherited) by user-defined classes.
Also, when a user defines his own class as a subclass of a built-in class,
he can use built-in methods and functions for the new class,
and the amount of description for a new program can be reduced.
For example, you may extend the {\tt cons} class to have extra field other
than {\tt car} and {\tt cdr} to define queues, trees, stacks, etc.
Even for these instances, built-in functions for
built-in cons are also applicable without any loss of efficiency,
since those functions recognize type hierarchy in a constant time.
Thus, EusLisp makes all the system built-in facilities open to programmers
in the form of extensible data types.
This uniformity is also beneficial to the implementation of EusLisp,
because, after defining a few kernel functions
such as {\bf defclass}, {\bf send}, and {\bf instantiate},
in the implementation language,
most of house-keeping functions to access the internal structure of built-in
data types can be coded in EusLisp itself.
This has much improved the reliability and maintainability of EusLisp.

\subsection{Features}

\begin{description}
\item [object-oriented programming]
EusLisp provides single-inheritance Object-Oriented programming.
All data types except numbers are represented by objects whose
behaviors are defined in their classes.
\item [Common Lisp] EusLisp follows the specifications of Common Lisp
described in \cite{CLtL} and \cite{CLtL2}
as long as they are consistent with EusLisp's goal and object-orientation.
See next subsection for incompatibilities.
\item [compiler]
EusLisp's compiler can boost the execution  5 to 30 
times as fast as the interpreted execution.
The compiler keeps the same semantics as the interpreter.
\item[memory management] Fibonacci buddy method,
which is memory efficient, GC efficient, and robust,
is used for the memory management.
EusLisp can run on machines with relatively modest amount of memory.
Users are free from the optimization of page allocation for each
type of data.
\item [geometric primitives]
Since numbers are always represented as immediate data,
no garbage is generated by numeric computation.
A number of geometric functions for arbitrary-sized  vectors and matrices
are provided as built-in functions.
\item [geometric modeler]
Solid models can be defined from primitive bodies using CSG set operations.
Mass properties, interference checking, contact detection, and so on,
are available.
\item [graphics]
Hidden-line eliminated drawing and hidden-surface eliminated rendering
are available.
Postscript output to idraw can be generated.
\item [image processing]
Edge based image processing facility is provided.
\item [manipulator model]
6 D.O.F.s robot manipulator can easily be modeled.
\item [Xwindow interface]
Three levels of Xwindow interface, the Xlib foreign functions, 
the Xlib classes and the original XToolKit classes are provided.
\item [foreign-language interface]
Functions written in C or other languages can be linked into EusLisp.
Bidirectional call between EusLisp and other language are supported.
Functions in libraries like LINPACK become available through this interface.
Call-back functions in X toolkits can be defined in Lisp.
\item [unix binding]
Most of unix system calls and unix library functions are assorted as Lisp
functions. Signal handling and asynchronous I/O are also possible.
\item [multithread] multithread programming, which enables multiple
contexts sharing global data, is available on Solaris 2 operating system.
Multithread facilitates asynchronous programming and improves real-time
response\cite{MTEus1,MTEus2}.
If EusLisp runs on multi-processor machines, it can utilize 
parallel processors' higher computating power.
%\item[disk save]
%EusLisp process image can be saved in a disk file to ease initial loading
%or to produce a complete application.
\end{description}

\subsection{Compatibility with Common Lisp}

Common Lisp has become the well-documented and widely-available standard Lisp
\cite{CLtL,CLtL2}.
Although EusLisp has introduced lots of Common Lisp features
such as variable scoping rules, packages, sequences, generalized variables,
blocks, structures, keyword parameters, etc.,
incompatibilities still remain.
Here is a list of missing features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item multiple values:
      multiple-value-call,multiple-value-prog1, etc., are present only
      in a limited way;
\item some of data types:
      complex number, bignum, character, deftype and ratio (this last
      one is present only in a limited way as well);
\item some of special forms:
      progv, compiler-let,macrolet
\end{enumerate}

Following features are incomplete:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item  closure -- only valid for dynamic extent
%\item  package --  no shadowing-list
\item  declare,proclaim -- inline and ignore are unrecognized
\end{enumerate}
