\section{Xwindow Interface}
\markright{\arabic{section}. Xwindow}
The Xwindow interface on EusLisp becomes available when EusLisp is
invoked by the name of {\tt 'eusx'}.
\footnote{Eusx is a symbolic link to eus.}
The "DISPLAY" environment variable should be properly set to your Xserver,
since eusx tries to connect to Xserver referencing
the "DISPLAY" environment variable when it starts up.

EusLisp defines three levels of xwindow interface:
(1) Xlib functions, (2) Xlib classes, and (3) XToolKit classes.
All the xwindow functions described in this section and the following
XToolKit section are contained in the "X" package.
The function names of the original Xlib are changed so that
all constituent letters are converted to upcase
and the first 'X' prefix is removed.
For example, {\tt XdefaultGC} is named {\tt X:DEFAULTGC},
not {\tt X:XDEFAULTGC}.

The Xlib functions are defined as foreign functions
as the lowest level interface to Xwindow system.
These Xlib functions should be used carefully, 
since parameter type check or parameter number check is not performed.
For an instance, all the Xlib call requests {\tt x:*display*} argument
to identify the connection to Xserver, and if you forget it, Xlib reports
an error and the process dies.
The second level interface, Xlib classes are provided
to avoid this inconvenience and to make the interface object-oriented.
%By instantiating the xwindow class, you will get a window on a screen,
%and sending messages to the instance, you can draw lines, strings, or whatever
%in it.
This section focuses on this second level interface.
Even higher level xwindow library called XToolKit is explained 
in the next section.

Classes described in this section have the following inheritance
hierarchy.

creates and initializes a xwindow.
When {\em parent} is given, this window is created as a subwindow
of {\em parent}, and is registered in the {\em subwindows} list of
the {\em parent}.
{\em X, y, size, width, height} and {\em border-width} determine
the location and the dimensions of this window.
{\em Save-under} and {\em backing-store} control the Xserver's behaviors
taken upon when the window is re-mapped. {\em Save-under} is either
T or NIL, while {\em backing-store} is either {\tt :notUseful, :WhenMapped},
or {\em :Always}.
When {\em backing-pixmap} is T, a pixmap of the same size as this window
is created by EusLisp, and maintained as a backing-store in case
the Xserver does not have the capability of backing-store.
{\em Border} and {\em background} specify the {\em border\_pixel}
and {\em background\_pixel} attributes, respectively.
{\em Map} should be set NIL, if this window should not appear
immediately after its creation, as is the case many small windows 
are created as panel-buttons in a {\bf panel}.
{\em Title} is the window title which appears in the title bar of 
the window.
{\em Name} is the name of the window stored in the property-list
of this xwindow object and printed by the printer.
X's events reported to this window are determined by 
{\em Event-mask}, that is, either an integer representing a bit-coded event-mask
or a list of the following symbols:
{\tt :key, :button, :enterLeave, :motion} and {\tt :configure}.
If more precise control is needed, the following symbols for each event
can be specified: {\em :keyPress, :keyRelease, :ButtonPress, :ButtonRelease,
:EnterWindow, :LeaveWindow, :PointerMotion, :PointerMotionHint, 
:ButtonMotion, :KeyMapState, :Exposure, :VisibilityChange, :StructureNotify,
:ResezeRedirect, :SubstructureNotify, :SubstructureRedirect,
:FocusChange, :PropertyChange, :ColormapChange} and {\tt :OwnerGrabButton}.
{\tt :Key} enables both {\tt :keyPress} and {\tt :KeyRelease}, and
{\tt :button} enables both {\tt :ButtonPress} and {\tt :ButtonRelease}.
When an event is sent from the server, \bfx{window-main-loop} analyzes
the event structure and send the {\tt :KeyPress, :KeyRelease, :buttonPress,
:ButtonRelease, :EnterNotify, :LeaveNotify, :MotionNotify, :ConfigureNotify}

\methoddesc{:destroy}{}{
destroys this xwindow and frees X resource.
The corresponding entries in {\tt *xwindows*} and {\tt *xwindow-hash-tab*}

\subsection{Colors and Colormaps}

\begin{refdesc}

\classdesc{colormap}{object}{(cmapid planes pixels LUT-list)}{
defines an xwindow colormap
and application oriented color look-up tables.
A color is represented by RGB values from 0 through 65535.
Color cells in a color map are addressed by their indices,
which are between 0 and 255 on 8-bit pseudo color display.}
\end{refdesc}

Here we assume your display device has 8bit pseudo color capability
which allows you to choose 256 colors at the same time.
Basically there are two ways in the use of color maps:
to share the system's default color map or to create private color maps.
If you use the system's default color map, you have to
be careful not to use up all the color cells in the map,
since the map is shared among many processes.
If you use private color maps, you can allocate all 256 color entries
in the map without worrying about other processes,
but  the map has to be explicitly attached to your private windows.
The color map is activated by the window manager
when the mouse pointer is moved somewhere in the window.

The system's default color map is set up in {\tt x:*color-map*}
which is an instance of the {\tt x:colormap} class
when eusx begins execution.
If you use private color maps, you create instances of {\tt x:colormap}.
These instances 
correspond to the colormap object defined in the x server and are identified by
the {\tt cmapid}  stored in each instance.

When you use the system's default color map, you can define {\em read-only}
colors which are shared with other processes or define {\em read-write}
colors which are private to your EusLisp.
{\em Read-only} means that you can define arbitrary
color when you allocate the color cell,
but you cannot change it after the allocation.
On the other hand,
{\em read-write} colors can be altered even after you defined them. 
Shared colors are {\em read-only} since other processes expect the colors to be
unchanged.
This {\em read-only} or {\em read-write} attribute is attached to each
color entry (often referred to as color cell).

A colormap object defines translation from a color id to a physical
representation that is a triplet of red, green and blue components.
However, these logical color ids cannot be chosen arbitrarily, especially when
you use the the system's default color map. The color id (often referred
to as 'pixel') is an index of a particular color in a color map and Xlib
chooses one of free indices for a shared color when allocation is requested.
Therefore, there is no way, for example, to  guarantee  many levels of
gray colors to be allocated contiguously or to begin from the first (zeroth)
index.  

From the viewpoint of applications, more logical color naming is needed.
For example,
a number of gray levels should be referred to with their brightness as indices.
A ray trace program may wish to assign contiguous indices to a group of colors
of different brightness defined in HLS model.

To cope with this problem, EusLisp's colormap provides another translation table
called LUT (look-up table). For a logical group of colors, you can define
a LUT and attach a symbolic name to it. More than one LUTs can be defined
in a colormap. 
LUT is an integer vector for the translation of application specific 
logical color indices into physical pixel values that the Xserver can recognize.
 
\begin{refdesc}

\methoddesc{:id}{}{
returns the cmap id.}

\methoddesc{:query}{pix}{
gets RGB values for the specific pixel number.}

\methoddesc{:alloc}{r g b}{
this method is the same as {\tt :store nil r g b}.
A new color cell is allocated in this colormap and is assigned with the
specified RGB values.}

\methoddesc{:store}{pix r g b}{
sets RGB values to the {\em pix}th color cell.}

\methoddesc{:store}{pix color-name}{
{\bf :Store} is the lowest level method to set a color in a color map.
In the first form, you specify the color with the red, green and blue components
between 0 and 65535 inclusively.  In the second form, you
specify the color by name like "red" or "navy-blue". If no such color-name is
found, nil is returned.
Pixel is either an integer which is the index in a color map or nil.
If it is integer, the color cell must be read-write-able. 
If it is nil, a shared read-only color cell is allocated.
{\tt :Store} returns the index of the color cell in the color map.}

\methoddesc{:store-hls}{pix hue lightness saturation}{
stores the color specified in HLS (Hue, Lightness and Saturation) model
in the {\em pix}th entry  of this colormap.
If {\em pix} is NIL, a shared read-only color cell is allocated.
{\tt :Store-hls} returns the index to the allocated color cell.}

\methoddesc{:destroy}{}{
destroys this colormap and frees resource.}

\methoddesc{:pixel}{LUT-name id}{
looks up in the LUT for the id'th entry and returns its pixel value.
{\em LUT-name} is the name of the look-up-table you defined by {\tt :define-LUT}.}

\methoddesc{:allocate-private-colors}{num}{
allocates {\em num} color cells in the private color map.}

\methoddesc{:allocate-colors}{rgb-list \&optional private}{
Each element of {\em rgb-list} is a list of red, green and blue components.
Color cells are allocated for each rgb value and an integer-vector
whose elements are pixel values is returned.}

\methoddesc{:define-LUT}{LUT-name rgb-list \&optional private}{
Colors described in {\em rgb-list} are allocated,
and an LUT is registered by the symbolic name of {\em LUT-name}.
In order to define private color cells, set {\em private} to T.}

\methoddesc{:define-gray-scale-LUT}{LUT-name levels \&optional private}{
allocates {\em levels} of color cells that represent linear 
gray scale colors and returns LUT.
For example, {\tt (send x:*color-map* :define-gray-scale-LUT 'gray8 8)}
allocates eight gray colors in the system's default color map, and
returns an integer vector such as {\tt \#i(29 30 31 48 49 50 51 0)}.
Physical pixel values can be inquired by sending the {\tt :pixel} message,
for example, {\tt (send x:*color-map* :pixel 'gray8 2)} returns 31.}
 
\methoddesc{:define-rgb-LUT}{LUT-name red green blue \&optional private}{
defines an LUT for shrunk RGB representation.
For example, if red=green=blue=2, totally $2^{2+2+2}=2^6=64$ color cells
are allocated.}

\methoddesc{:define-hls-LUT}{LUT-name count hue low-brightness high-brightness saturation \&optional private}{
allocates {\em count} colors using the HLS model. Colors of the given {\em hue} (0..360),
{\em saturation} (0..1), and different levels of brightness between
{\em low-brightness}
and {\em high-brightness} are stored in the color map. A LUT named LUT-name
is also created.}

\methoddesc{:define-rainbow-LUT}{LUT-name \&optional (count 32) (hue-start 0) (hue-end 360) (brightness 0.5) (saturation 1.0) private}{
allocates {\em count} colors using the HLS model.
Colors of the given {\em brightness} (0..1),
{\em saturation} (0..1), and different hues between
{\em hue-start} and {\em hue-end}
are stored in the color map.
A LUT named {\em LUT-name} is also created.}

\methoddesc{:LUT-list}{}{
returns all LUT list defined in this colormap.
Each entry in the list is a pair of the LUT-name and an integer vector.}

\methoddesc{:LUT-names}{}{
returns the name list of all LUT in this colormap.}

\methoddesc{:LUT}{name}{
returns the integer-vector (LUT) identified by {\em name}.}

\methoddesc{:size}{LUT}{
returns the length of {\em LUT}}

\methoddesc{:planes}{}{
returns planes of this colormap.}

%\metdesc{:planes-bits}{}
%\metdesc{:planes-shifts}{}

\methoddesc{:set-window}{xwin}{
associates this colormap to the {\em xwin} window.
This colormap is activated when the cursor enters in {\em xwin}.}

\methoddesc{:free}{pixel-or-LUT}{
frees a specific color cell addressed by pixel, or all the entries in LUT.}

\methoddesc{:init}{\&optional cmapid}{
initializes this color map with cmap id.
All the LUTs registered are discarded.}

\methoddesc{:create}{\&key (planes 0) (colors 1) (visual *visual*) contiguous}{
