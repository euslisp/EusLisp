\section{Sequences, Arrays and Tables}
\markright{\arabic{section}. Sequences, Arrays and Tables}

\subsection{General Sequences}

Vectors (one dimensional arrays) and lists are generic sequences.
A string is a sequence, since it is a vector of characters.

For the specification of result type in
{\bf map, concatenate} and {\bf coerce},
use class name symbol, such as {\tt cons, string, integer-vector, float-vector},
etc. without quotes, 
since the class object is bound to the symbol.

\begin{refdesc}

\funcdesc{elt}{sequence pos}{
{\bf elt} is the most general function to get and put (in conjunction with
{\bf setf}) value at the specific position {\em pos} in {\em sequence}.
{\em Sequence} may be a list, or a vector of arbitrary
object, bit, char, integer, or float.
{\bf Elt} cannot be applied to a multi-dimensional array.}

\funcdesc{length}{sequence}{
returns the length of {\em sequence}.
For vectors, {\bf length} finishes in constant time, but
time proportional to the length is required for a list.
{\bf Length} never terminates if {\em sequence} is a circular list.
Use \bfx{list-length}, instead.
If {\em sequence} is an array with a fill-pointer, {\bf length}
returns the fill-pointer, not the entire size of the array entity.
Use {\bf array-total-size} to know the entire size of those arrays.}

\funcdesc{subseq}{sequence start \&optional end}{
makes a copy of the subsequence from {\em start}th through  ({\em end}-1)th inclusively
out of {\em sequence}.
{\em end} is defaulted to the length of {\em sequence}.}

\funcdesc{copy-seq}{sequence}{
does shallow-copying of {\em sequence}, that is, 
only the top-level references in {\em sequence} are copied.
Use {\bf copy-tree} to copy a nested list,
or {\bf copy-object} for deep-copying of a sequence
containing recursive references.}

\funcdesc{reverse}{sequence}{
reverse the order of  {\em sequence} and returns a new sequence of the
same type as {\em sequence}.}

\funcdesc{nreverse}{sequence}{
{\bf Nreverse} is the destructive version of {\bf reverse}.
{\bf Nreverse} does not allocate memory, while {\bf reverse} does.}

\funcdesc{concatenate}{result-type \&rest sequences}{
concatenates all {\em sequences}.
Each {\em sequence} may be of any sequence type.
Unlike {\bf append}, all the sequences including the last one are copied.
{\em Result-type} should be a class such as cons, string,
vector, float-vector etc.}

\funcdesc{coerce}{sequence result-type}{
changes the type of {\em sequence}.
For examples, {\tt (coerce '(a b c) vector) = \#(a b c)}  and 
{\tt (coerce "ABC" cons) = (a b c)}.
A new sequence of type {\em result-type} is created, and each element of
{\em sequence} is copied to it.
{\em result-type} should be one of vector, integer-vector, float-vector,
bit-vector, string, cons or other user-defined classes inheriting 
one of these.
Note that {\em sequence} is copied even if its type equals to {\em result-type}.}

\funcdesc{map}{result-type function seq \&rest more-seqs}{
{\em function} is applied to a list of arguments taken from {\em seq}
and {\em more-seqs} orderly, and the result is accumulated in a sequence
of type {\em result-type}. For example, you can write as follows: {\tt (map float-vector \#'(lambda (x) (* x x)) (float-vector 1 2 3))}}

\funcdesc{fill}{sequence item \&key (start 0) (end (length sequence))}{
fills {\em item} from {\em start}th through ({\em end}-1)th in {\em sequence}.}

\funcdesc{replace}{dest source \&key start1 end1 start2 end2}{
elements in {\em dest} sequence indexed between {\em start1} and {\em end1}
are replaced with elements in {\em source} indexed between 
{\em start2} and {\em end2}.
{\em start1} and {\em start2} are defaulted to zero, and
{\em end1} and {\em end2} to the length of each sequence.
If the one of subsequences is longer than the other,
its end is truncated to match with the shorter subsequence.}

\funcdesc{sort}{sequence compare \&optional key}{
{\em sequence} is destructively sorted using Unix's quick-sort subroutine.
{\em key} is not a keyword parameter.
Be careful with the sorting of a sequence which have same elements.
For example, {\tt (sort '(1 1) \#'>)} fails because comparisons
between 1 and 1 in both direction fail.
To avoid this problem, use functions like \#'$>=$ or \#'$<=$ for comparison.}

\funcdesc{merge}{result-type seq1 seq2 pred \&key (key \#'identity)}{
two sequences {\em seq1} and {\em seq2} are merged to form a single
sequence of {\em result-type} whose elements 
satisfy the comparison specified by {\em pred}.}

\funcdesc{merge-list}{list1 list2 pred key}{
merges two lists. Unlike {\bf merge} no general sequences are allowed 
for the arguments, but {\bf merge-list} runs faster than {\bf merge}.}

\end{refdesc}

Following functions consist of one basic function and its variants
suffixed by -if and -if-not.
The basic form takes at least the item and sequence arguments,
and compares item with each element in the sequence,
and do some processing,
such as finding the index,
counting the number of appearances, removing the item, etc.
Variant forms take predicate and sequence arguments,
applies the predicate to each element of sequence, and do something
if the predicate returns non-nil (-if version), or nil (-if-not version).

\begin{refdesc}

\funcdesc{position}{item seq \&key start end test test-not key (count 1)}{
finds {\em count}th appearance of {\em item} in {\em seq} and returns
its index.

by the {\em test} or {\em test-not} parameter.}

creates a new sequence which has eliminated {\em count} (defaulted to infinity)
occurrences of of {\em item}(s) between the {\em start}th element
and the {\em end}th element in {\em seq}.
If you are sure that there is only one occurrence of {\em item},
{\em count=1} should be specified to avoid meaningless scan over the whole
sequence.}

destructively and does not create a new sequence.
If you are sure that there is only one occurrence of {\em item},
{\em count=1} should be specified to avoid meaningless scan over the whole
sequence.}

\fundesc{delete-if}{predicate seq \&key start end key count}

\funcdesc{delete-if-not}{predicate seq \&key start end key count}{
{\em count} for {\em remove}s and {\em delete}s is defaulted to 1,000,000.
If you have a long sequence and you want to delete an element which
appears only once, :count should be specified as 1.}

\funcdesc{substitute}{newitem olditem seq \&key start end test test-not key count}{
returns a new sequence which has 
substituted the {\em count} occurrence(s)
of {\em olditem} in {\em seq} with {\em newitem}.

\subsection{Vectors and Arrays}

Up to seven dimensional arrays are allowed.
A one-dimensional array is called vector.
Vectors and lists are grouped as sequence.
If the elements of an array is of any type, the array is said to be general.
If an array does not have fill-pointer, is not displaced to
another array, or is adjustable, the array is said to be simple.

Every array element can be recalled by {\bf aref} and set by {\bf setf} in
conjunction with aref.
But for simple vectors, there are simpler and faster access functions:
{\bf svref} for simple general vectors, {\bf char} and {\bf schar} for
simple character vectors (string), {\bf bit} and {\bf sbit} for
simple bit vectors.  When these functions are compiled,
the access is expanded in-line and no type check and boundary check are 
performed.

Since a vector is also an object,
it can be made by instantiating some vector-class.
There are five kinds of built-in vector-classes;
vector, string, float-vector, integer-vector and bit-vector.
In order to ease instantiation of vectors, the function make-array
is provided.
Element-type should be one of {\bf :integer, :bit, :character, :float, :foreign}
or user-defined vector class.
{\bf :initial-element} and {\bf :initial-contents} key word arguments are
available to set initial values of the array you make.

\funcdesc{svref}{vector pos}{
returns {\em pos}th element of {\em vector}.
{\em Vector} must be a simple general vector.}

\funcdesc{aref}{vector \&rest indices}{

\funcdesc{vector-push}{val array}{
store {\em val} at the {\em fill-pointer}th slot in {\em array}.

\end{refdesc}

\subsection{Foreign Strings}
A foreign-string is a kind of byte-vector whose entity is held somewhere
outside EusLisp's heap.
While a normal string is represented by a sequence of bytes and its length,
a foreign-string holds the length and the address of the string entity.
Although foreign-string is a string,
some string and  sequence functions cannot be applicable.
Only {\bf length}, {\bf aref}, {\bf replace}, {\bf subseq} and {\bf copy-seq}
recognize the foreign-string, 
and application of other functions may cause a crash.

A foreign-string may refer to a part of I/O space usually
taken in /dev/a??d?? special file where ?? is either 32 or 16.
In case the device attached in one of these I/O space only responds
to byte access, {\bf replace} always copies element byte by byte,
which is relatively slow when a large chunk of memory is accessed
consecutively.

\begin{refdesc}

\funcdesc{make-foreign-string}{address length}{
makes an instance of foreign-string located at {\em address} 
and spanning for {\em length} bytes.
For example, {\tt (make-foreign-string (unix:malloc 32) 32)}
makes a reference to a 32-byte memory located outside EusLisp's heap.}

\end{refdesc}
\newpage

\subsection{Hash Tables}

Hash-table is a class to search for the value associated with a key,
as accomplished by {\bf assoc}.
For a relatively large problem,
hash-table performs better than assoc, since time required for searching remains constant even
the number of key-value pairs increases.
Roughly speaking, hash-table should be used in search spaces with
more than 100 elements, and assoc in smaller spaces.

Hash-tables automatically expands if the number of elements
in the table exceeds rehash-size.
By default, expansion occurs when a half of the table is filled.
{\bf sxhash} function returns a hash value which is independent
of memory address of an object, and hash values for {\bf equal} objects
are always the same.
So, hash tables can be re-loadable since they use sxhash as their default
hashing functions.
While sxhash is robust and safe,
it is relatively slow because it scans all the elements 
in a sequence or a tree.
For faster hashing, you may choose another hash function appropriate
for your application.
To change the hash function, send {\tt :hash-function} message
to the hash-table.
In simple cases, it is useful to change hash function from \#'{\bf sxhash}
to \#'{\bf sys:address}.
This is possible because the addresses of any objects
never change in a EusLisp process.

\begin{refdesc}

\funcdesc{sxhash}{obj}{
calculates the hash value for {\em obj}.
Two objects which are {\bf equal} are guaranteed to yield
the same hash value.
For a symbol, hash value for its pname is returned.
For numbers, their integer representations are returned.
For a list, sum of hash values for all its elements is returned.
For a string, shifted sum of each character code is returned.
For any other objects, {\bf sxhash} is recursively called to calculate
the hash value of each slot, and the sum of them is returned.}

\funcdesc{make-hash-table}{\&key (size 30) (test \#'eq) (rehash-size 2.0)}{
creates a hash table and returns it.}


\funcdesc{gethash}{key htab}{
gets the value that corresponds to {\em key} in {\em htab}.
{\bf Gethash} is also used to set a value to key by combining with {\bf setf}.
When a new entry is entered in a hash table, and the number of filled slots
in the table exceeds 1/rehash-size, then the hash table is automatically
expanded to twice larger size.}

\funcdesc{remhash}{key htab}{
removes a hash entry designated by {\em key} in {\em htab}.}

\funcdesc{maphash}{function htab}{
maps {\em function} to all the elements of {\em htab}.}

\funcdesc{hash-table-p}{x}{
T if {\em x} is an instance of class hash-table.}

\classdesc{hash-table}{object}{(key value count \\
\> hash-function test-function \\
\> rehash-size empty deleted)}{
defines hash table.
{\em Key} and {\em value} are simple-vectors of the same {\em size}.
{\em Count} is the number of filled slots in {\em key} and {\em value}.
{\em Hash-function} is defaulted to {\bf sxhash} and
{\em test-function} to {\bf eq}.
{\em Empty} and {\em deleted} are uninterned symbols to indicate
slots are empty or deleted in the {\em key} vector.}

\methoddesc{:hash-function}{newhash}{
changes the hash function of this hash table to {\em newhash}.
{\em Newhash} must be a function with one argument and returns an integer.
One of candidates for {\em newhash} is {\bf system:address}.}

\subsection{Queue}

A queue is a data structure that allows insertion and retrieval of data
in the FIFO manner, i.e. the first-in first-out order.
Since the queue class is defined by extending the cons class,
ordinary list functions can be applied to a queue.
For example, caar retrieves the next element to be dequeued,
and cadr gets the element that is queued most recently.

\begin{refdesc}

\classdesc{queue}{cons}{(car cdr)}{
defines queue (FIFO) objects.}

\methoddesc{:init}{}{
initializes the queue to have no elements.}

\methoddesc{:enqueue}{val}{
puts val in the queue as the most recent element.}

\methoddesc{:dequeue}{\&optional (error-p nil)}{
retrieves the oldest value in the queue, and removes it of the queue.
If the queue is empty, it reports an error when error-p is non-nil,
or returns NIL otherwise.}

\methoddesc{:empty?}{}{
returns T if the queue is empty.}

\methoddesc{:length}{}{
returns the length of the queue.}

\methoddesc{:trim}{s}{
discard old entries to keep the size of this queue to s.}

\methoddesc{:search}{item \&optional (test \#'equal)}{
find element which is equal to item.
the search is performed by equal, which can be altered by test}

\methoddesc{:delete}{item \&optional (test \#'equal) (count 1)}{
eliminate count occurrences of item in this queue.}

\methoddesc{:first}{}{
returns the first entry (oldest value) of this queue.}

\methoddesc{:last}{}{
returns tha last entry (newest value) of this queue.}

\end{refdesc}
