\section{Image Processing}

\markright{\arabic{section}. Image Processing}
Image processing facilities are defined in {\tt "vision/piximage"}.
For the representations of image data, two classes,
{\bf pixel-image} and {\bf color-pixel-image}, are defined.
Pixel by pixel translations through look-up tables,
edge-finder, and image data transfer in pbm formats are realized.

\subsection{Look-Up Tables (LUT)}
An LUT is a vector for the translation of pixel data.

\begin{refdesc}

\funcdesc{make-equilevel-lut}{levels \&optional (size 256)}{
returns a one-dimensional integer-vector that linearly maps values between
0 and {\em size} into values between 0 and {\em levels}.
For example, {\tt (make-equilevel-lut 3 12)} returns
{\tt \#i(0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2)}.}

\funcdesc{look-up}{src dest lut}{
translates values stored in {\em src} vector into {\em dest} vector
using {\em lut}. If {\em dest} is nil, a vector of the same class and
size as {\em src} is created.
For example, {\tt (look-up \#i(1 2 3) nil \#(10 20 30 40 50))}
returns {\tt \#i(20 30 40)}.}

\funcdesc{look-up2}{src dest lut1 lut2}{
{\em Src} and {\em dest} are integer-vector or byte-vector (string) of the same
size.
{\tt :Look-up2} translates {\em src} into {\em dest} looking-up {\em lut1} and {\em lut2}
successively.}

\funcdesc{look-up*}{src dest luts}{
{\em luts} is a list of look-up tables.
{\em src} is translated into {\em dest} successively looking up look-up tables
given in {\em luts}.}

\funcdesc{concatenate-lut}{lut1 lut2 \&optional (size 256)}{
concatenates two look-up tables {\em lut1} and {\em lut2},
and returns a new look-up table which performs the same translation
as {\em lut1} and {\em lut2} are looked-up successively.}

\vardesc{*x-gray32-lut*}{LUT to translate 32-level gray-scale into
the pixel values in the default color map {\tt x:*colormap*}.
{\tt (aref *x-gray32-lut* n)} returns the pixel value for nth gray-level
out of 32 levels.}

\vardesc{*x-gray16-lut*}{LUT to translate 16-level gray-scale pixel
into the index of x's default color map  {\tt x:*colormap*}.}

\vardesc{*x-color-lut*}{LUT for several vivid colors defined in 
{\tt x:*color-map*}.
Registered colors are "black", "red", "green", "lightblue", "yellow",
"orange", "blue", "magenta", "white".}

\vardesc{*256to8*}{256-entry LUT to translate integers in range of 0..255
into 0..7. The levels are linearly mapped.}

\vardesc{*256to16*}{256-entry LUT to translate integers in range of 0..255
into 0..15. The levels are linearly mapped.}

\vardesc{*256to32*}{256-entry LUT to translate integers in range of 0..255
into 0..31. The levels are linearly mapped.}

\vardesc{*gray32*}{256-entry LUT to translate the raw gray-scale pixels 
into X's color map indices.
This is made by concatenating two LUTs, {\tt *256to32*} and
{\tt *x-gray32-lut*}.
An Xwindow display-able pixel-image with 32 gray-levels 
can be obtained by translating
the 256-level raw image by {\bf *gray32*}.}

\vardesc{*rainbow32*}{256-entry LUT to translate 256-level
hue values into into X's rainbow color map indices.
This is made by concatenating two LUTs, {\tt *256to32*} and
{\tt *x-rainbow32-lut*}.}

\end{refdesc}

\subsection{Pixel-Image}

A single plane of 
image data is represented by  {\bf pixel-image} object.
{\bf pixel-image} is a two-dimensional array of bytes.
The interpretation of each byte is application dependent.
Although it is most commonly used to represent brightness of a pixel,
it may be used to represent edge intensity, gradient direction,
color component intensity, bar graph, or whatever.

\subsection{Color-Pixel-Image}
Color images are represented by {\bf color-pixel-image} objects
which have three {\bf pixel-image} objects to represent red, green, and
blue components in RGB representation,
or hue, lightness, and saturation components in the HLS model.
Conversion between RGB and HLS is supported.

designated by {\em win} by using {\tt :putimage}.
Each pixel value is referred as a index in x's color map.

\end{refdesc}

Provided a ppm file, you can extract color (hue) values out of the image
and display it in an xwindow by the following program.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
(setq ppmimg (read-pnm "xxx.ppm"))
(send ppmimg :hls)   ; RGB to HLS conversion
(make-ximage (send ppmimg :hue) *rainbow32*)

\end{quote}

\subsection{Edge Finder}
%エッジ抽出

Edge Finding facilities are provided by {\tt "vision/edge/edge"}.

\begin{refdesc}
\longdescription{edge1}{img \=\&optional \=(method 1) \`[function]\\
		    \>\>(th1 *edge-intensity-threshold*)
		    (th2 *weak-edge-threshold*) \\
		    \>\>(run *edge-length-threshold*)
		    result\\
	\>\&aux (width (send img :width)) (height (send img :height))}{
finds edge pixels in this image.
{\bf edge1} first applies a gradient operator to every pixel.
There are three kinds of gradient operators provided:
{\bf grad3} which takes difference between horizontally and vertically 
neighboring pixels,
{\bf prewitt} and {\bf sobel}.
{\em method}=0,1 selects {\bf grad3}, 2 selects {\bf prewitt} and 3 selects
{\bf sobel}.
Pixels that have edge intensity greater than {\em th1} are identified as
strong edge pixels.
After thinning edges referring to edge intensities and
directions of gradient, isolated edge pixels are marked.
Starting from end points of these strong edges, weak edge pixels
that are consistent with the strong edge's direction are searched for and linked
to compose elongated lines.
Weak edge pixels that have greater edge intensity than {\em th2} are
unconditionally linked.
Even very weak edge pixels that have less edge intensity than {\em th2}
can be linked as long as they connect to another weak or strong edge
within {\em run} length.
{\bf edge1} returns a pixel-image object
each pixel of which represents either a strong edge pixel (=1),
a weak and elongated edge pixel (=2),
or an isolated pixel (=255).}

\funcdesc{overlay-edge}{ximg edgeimg}{
displays {\em edgeimg} obtained by {\bf edge1} on top of
x-display-able pixel image {\em ximg}.
Strong edge pixels are colored in red, weak pixels in green, and
isolated pixels in blue.}
