Foreign Language Interface</A>
</H2>

<P>
Functions written in C without concern about linking with EusLisp
can be loaded onto EusLisp, too.
These functions are called foreign functions.
Such programs are loaded by
<B>load-foreign</B> macro which returns an instance of <B>foreign-module</B>.
External symbol definitions in the object file is registered
in the module object.
<B>Defforeign</B> is used to make entries to  C functions
to be called from EusLisp.
<B>Defun-c-callable</B> defines lisp functions callable from C.
C-callable functions have special code piece called <EM>pod-code</EM>
for converting parameters and transferring control to the corresponding
EusLisp function.
<B>Pod-address</B> returns the address of this code piece which
should be informed to C functions.

<P>
Here is an example of C program and its interface functions to EusLisp.
<PRE>
/* C program named cfunc.c*/

static int (*g)();	/* variable to store Lisp function entry */

double sync(x)
double x;
{ extern double sin();
  return(sin(x)/x);}

char *upperstring(s)
char *s;
{ char *ss=s;
  while (*s) { if (islower(*s)) *s=toupper(*s); s++;}
  return(ss);}

int setlfunc(f)      /* remember the argument in g just to see */
int (*f)();          /* how Lisp function can be called from C */
{ g=f;}

int callfunc(x)      /* apply the Lisp function saved in g to the arg.*/
int x;
{ return((*g)(x));}

;;;; Example program for EusLisp's foreign language interface
;;;; make foreign-module
(setq m (load-foreign "cfunc.o"))

;; define foreign functions so that they can be callable from lisp
(defforeign sync m "sync" (:float) :float)
(defforeign toupper m "upperstring" (:string) :string)
(defforeign setlfunc m "setlfunc" (:integer) :integer)
(defforeign callfunc m "callfunc" (:integer) :integer)

;; call them
(sync 1.0)	--&gt; 0.841471
(print (toupper "abc123"))  --&gt; "ABC123"

;; define a test function which is callable from C.
(defun-c-callable TEST ((a :integer)) :integer
      (format t "TEST is called, arg=~s~%" a)
      (* a a))    ;; return the square of the arg
;;  call it from C
;;setlfunc remembers the entry address of Lisp TEST function.
(setlfunc (pod-address (intern "TEST")))
(callfunc 12)  --&gt; TEST is called, arg=12  144
</PRE>

<P>
Data representations in EusLisp are converted to those of C in the following
manners:
EusLisp's 30-bits integer (including character)
is sign-extended and passed to a C function via stack.
30-bit float is extended to double and passed via stack.
As for string, integer-vector and float-vector,
only the address of the first element is passed on the stack,
and the entire array remains uncopied.
The string can either be a normal string or a foreign-string.
A string may contain null codes, though it is guaranteed
that the string also has a null code at the end.
EusLisp does not know how to pass arrays of more than one dimension.
Every array of more than one dimension has correspoiding one dimensional
vector that holds the entire elements linearly.
This vector is obtained by the <B>array-entity</B> macro.
Also, note that a two-dimensional matrix should be transposed
if it is sent to the FORTRAN subroutines, since rows and columns
are ordered oppositely in FORTRAN.

<P>
Since EusLisp's representation of floating-point numbers is always single
precision, conversion is required when you pass a vector of double precision
floating point numbers.
For this purpose, the conversion functions,
<B>double2float</B> and <B>float2double</B> are provided
by <TT>clib/double.c</TT>.
For an instance, if you have a 3x3 float-matrix and want to pass it to a C
function named cfun as a matrix of double, use the following forms.
<PRE>
     (setq mat (make-matrix 3 3))
     (cfun (float2double (array-entity mat)))
</PRE>

<P>
Struct in C can be defined by the <B>defcstruct</B> macro.
<B>Defcstruct</B> accepts struct-name followed by 
field definition forms.

<P>
<PRE>
     (defcstruct &lt;struct-name&gt;
        {(&lt;field&gt; &lt;type&gt; [*] [size])}*)
</PRE>
For example, following struct definition is represented by the next defcstruct.
<PRE>
     /* C definition */
     struct example {
        char  a[2];
        short b;
        long  *c;
        float *d[2];};

     /* equivalent EusLisp definition */
     (defcstruct example
        (a :char 2)
        (b :short)
        (c :long *)
        (d :float * 2))

<B>load-foreign</B> <EM>objfile &amp;key symbol-input symbol-output (symbol-file objfile) ld-option) </EM>[macro]

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 
<DD> loads an object module written in languages other than EusLisp.
In Solaris2, <B>load-foreign</B> just calls <B>load</B> with a null string
as its <EM>:entry</EM> parameter.
A compiled-code object is returned.
This result is necessary to make entries to the functions in the module by
<B>defforeign</B> called later on.
Libraries can be specified in <EM>ld-option</EM>.
However, the symbols defined in the libraries cannot be captured
in the default symbol-output file.
In order to allow EusLisp to call functions defined in the libraries,
<EM>symbol-output</EM> and <EM>symbol-file</EM> must be given explicitly.
(These arguments are not needed if you are not going to call the library
functions directly from EusLisp, i.e. if you are  referring them only from
functions in <EM>objfile</EM>).
<B>Load-foreign</B> links <EM>objfile</EM> with libraries specified and global
symbols in EusLisp which is in core, and writes the linked object in
<EM>symbol-output</EM>.
Then, symbols in <EM>symbol-file</EM> are searched and listed in the
foreign-module. Since <EM>symbol-file</EM> is defaulted to be <EM>objfile</EM>,
only the symbols defined in <EM>objfile</EM> are  recognized if <EM>symbol-file</EM>
is not given. To find all the global entries both in <EM>objfile</EM> and
libraries, the linked (merged) symbol table resulted from the first link
process of load-foreign must be examined.
For this reason, an identical file name must be given both to <EM>symbol-output</EM>
and to <EM>symbol-file</EM>.

<P>
As shown below, the intermediate symbol file can be removed
by <B>unix:unlink</B>.
However, if you are loading more than one foreign modules both of which 
refer to the same library, and if you want to avoid loading
the library duplicatedly, you have to use <EM>symbol-input</EM> argument.
Suppose you have loaded all the functions in "linpack.a" in the above
example and you are going to load another file "linapp.o" that calls functions
in "linpack.a".
The following call of load-foreign should be issued before you
unlink "euslinpack".
<TT>(load-foreign "linapp.o" :symbol-input "euslinpack")</TT>
See <TT>*eusdir*/llib/linpack.l</TT> for more complete examples of
<B>load-foreign</B> and <B>defforeign</B>.

</DD>

(setq linpack-module
    (load-foreign "/usr/local/eus/clib/linpackref.o"

        :symbol-output "euslinpack"

<B>defforeign</B> <EM>funcname module cname paramspec resulttype </EM>[macro]

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 
<DD> 
makes a function entry in a foreign language module.
<EM>funcname</EM> is a symbol to be created in EusLisp.
<EM>module</EM> is  a compiled-code object returned by <B>load-foreign</B>.
<EM>cname</EM> is the name of the C-function defined in the foreign program.
It is a string like "_myfunc". 
<EM>paramspec</EM> is a list of parameter type specifications
which is used for the data type conversion and coercion when arguments are
passed from EusLisp to the C function.
<EM>Paramspec</EM> can be NIL if no data conversion or type check is required.
One of <B>:integer, :float , :string</B>, or <EM>(:string n)</EM> must be
given to <EM>resulttype</EM>.
<B>:Integer</B> means that the c function returns either char, short or
int (long).
<B>:Float</B> should be specified both for float and double.
<B>:String</B> means the C function returns a pointer to a string,
and EusLisp should add a long-word header to the  string to accomodate it
as a EusLisp string.
The length of the string is found by <EM>strlen</EM>.
Note that the writing a header just before the string may cause
a disastrous result.
On the other hand, <B>(:string n)</B> is safer but slower because
a EusLisp string of length <B>n</B> is newly created and the contents of
C string is copied there.
<TT>(:string 4)</TT> should be used for a C function that returns a pointer
to an integer.  The resulted integer value of the result can be obtained by
<TT>(sys:peek result :long)</TT>, where result is a variable set to the
result of the C function.
You may also specify <TT>(:foreign-string [n])</TT> for C functions
that return a string or a struct.
The result is a foreign-string whose content is held somewhere outside
EusLisp control.
If the result string is null-terminated and the length of the string
is known by strlen, you don't need to specify the length [n].
However, if the result contains null codes, which is usual for structs,
the length of the foreign-string should be explicitly given.
Whether you should use (:string n) or (:foreign-string n) is not
only the matter of speed, but the matter of structure sharing.
The difference is whether the result is copied or not.

<P>
Fortran users should note that every argument to a Fortran function or a
subroutine is passed by call-by-reference.
Therefore, even a simple integer or float type argument must be  put
in a integer-vector or a float-vector before it is passed to Fortran.

<B>defun-c-callable</B> <EM>funcname paramspec resulttype . body </EM>[macro]

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 
<DD> 
defines a EusLisp function that can be called from foreign language code.
<EM>funcname</EM> is a symbol for which a EusLisp function is defined.
<EM>paramspec</EM> is a list of type specifiers as in <B>defforeign</B>.
Unlike <B>defforeign</B>'s paramspec, <B>defun-c-callable</B>'s paramspec
cannot be omitted unless the function does not receive any argument.
<EM>:integer</EM> should be used for all of int, short and char types
and <EM>:float</EM> for both of float and double.
<EM>resulttype</EM> is the type of the Lisp function.
<EM>resulttype</EM> can be omitted unless you need type check or type coercion from integer
to float.
<EM>body</EM> is lisp expressions that are executed when this function is
called from C.
The function defined by <B>defun-c-callable</B> can be called from Lisp
expressions, too.
<B>Defun-c-callable</B> returns <EM>funcname</EM>.
It looks like a symbol, but it is not, but an instance of <A NAME="23218"></A><B>f</B>oreign-pod
which is a subclass of symbol.
