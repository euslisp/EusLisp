;; eus.init.l
;; When euslisp boots up, it calls 'sys:exec-module-init to initialize
;; modules. We assume the kernel of euslisp does not know what modules are
;; linked in the kernel or in the libraries.
;; On Solaris, this information is given by #pragma init, whereas,
;; on other systems, cc (or gcc) does not recognize such compiler directive.
;; So, this file provides the names of initilization entries of all the
;; modules linked.  This file is read at the boot time and substitute the
;; system::*load-entries*, which is looked up in the eusrt.l.
;; 
;; Oct/1997  RGBHLS, pixword, Xcolor are added.
